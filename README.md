# ML Models for Fraud Detection in an Insurance Company
## ML Models Used and Findings

### Neural Network
The project utilizes a neural network approach designed for binary classification. The network is built with multiple layers that allow it to learn complex patterns in the data. Key characteristics include:
- **Architecture**: Typically includes an input layer, several hidden layers with activation functions like ReLU, and an output layer with sigmoid activation for probability estimation.
- **Training**: Uses backpropagation with optimization techniques such as Adam or SGD. Regularization methods like dropout are applied to prevent overfitting.
- **Performance**: The neural network effectively captures intricate relationships within the data. It demonstrates strong performance in detecting subtle indicators of fraud, evidenced by improvements in precision and recall metrics during evaluation.

### HisGradientBoostClassifier
The HisGradientBoostClassifier is an advanced variant of the traditional gradient boosting algorithm optimized for handling imbalanced and complex datasets. Its highlights include:
- **Boosting Technique**: It leverages sequential ensemble learning, reweighting errors from previous iterations to focus on difficult-to-classify cases.
- **Handling Complexity**: Well-suited for datasets with non-linear relationships and noise, this classifier aggregates weak learners to deliver robust predictive power.
- **Results**: The classifier shows high accuracy and reliable ROC-AUC scores. It is particularly effective in scenarios where the decision boundary is not clear, improving overall model interpretability and risk assessment.

### Comparative Findings
- **Robustness**: While the neural network adapts well to diverse inputs through its layered architecture, the HisGradientBoostClassifier handles outliers and skewed class distributions robustly.
- **Performance Metrics**: Both models were evaluated across multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The neural network provided insightful probabilistic predictions, whereas the boosting classifier delivered consistent performance even on imbalanced data.
- **Usage Scenario**: Depending on the specific requirements of the fraud detection task—such as the need for interpretability or handling highly imbalanced classes—one model may be preferable over the other. Combining their strengths through ensemble methods could further enhance detection capabilities.

These insights guide users in selecting the appropriate model and help in fine-tuning their implementations for optimal fraud detection efficacy.
## Cost Benefit Analysis

Evaluating the cost and benefits of adopting each model is essential to ensure both effective and economically viable fraud detection:

- **Initial Investment**:  
    Establishing a neural network typically requires greater computational resources and time compared to the gradient boosting approach. This consideration affects hardware costs and development time.

- **Operational Costs**:  
    The neural network's training and updating cycles might incur higher ongoing costs. In contrast, the HisGradientBoostClassifier can be more cost-efficient when processing large, imbalanced datasets.

- **Return on Investment (ROI)**:  
    Enhanced detection accuracy can translate into significant fraud loss reductions. Quantifying potential savings based on decreased fraud incidence helps justify the model costs.

- **Risk Mitigation**:  
    Both models contribute to proactive fraud prevention. However, the neural network may offer deeper insights with probabilistic outputs, while the boosting classifier consistently handles data imbalances—each reducing financial risk in different ways.

- **Scalability and Maintenance**:  
    Maintenance for a neural network can be more resource-intensive due to the need for periodic retraining and fine-tuning as data evolves. The boosting model, with its ensemble nature, may offer easier scalability and stability.

These factors combined can assist stakeholders in selecting and optimizing the model that best balances technical performance against financial investment.
